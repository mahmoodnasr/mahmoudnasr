          <h4>Who it's for</h4>
          <p>Founders who have a product but can't articulate why someone should care. You've rewritten your homepage five times. Your pitch keeps shifting. You need an outside perspective from someone who gets startups.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>What problem it solves</h4>
          <p>You're too close to your own product to see what's compelling about it. The Clarity Call gives you an external, experienced set of eyes to cut through your own noise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>What you get</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>60-minute 1-on-1 video session focused entirely on your messaging and positioning</li>
            <li>A follow-up email within 24 hours with a written summary: your refined positioning angle, 2–3 concrete messaging changes, and one priority action item</li>
            <li>One round of async follow-up questions via email within 7 days of the call</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>Expected outcome</h4>
          <p>You walk away knowing exactly what to say on your homepage, in your pitch, and in your outbound — and why it works.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>Boundaries</h4>
          <p>This is a single session, not ongoing support. If you need deeper work, the Sprint is the next step.</p>

          <h4>Who it's for</h4>
          <p>Founders preparing to launch, raise, or reposition. You need more than a quick gut-check — you need to build messaging and brand strategy from the ground up, in a compressed timeline.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>What problem it solves</h4>
          <p>You don't have months to figure out your brand. You need a structured, time-boxed engagement that produces real output — not a report that sits in a Google Doc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>What you get</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>4-week engagement with one 90-minute working session per week</li>
            <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Audit of current positioning, competitive landscape, and audience clarity</li>
            <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Co-creation of your core brand narrative and key differentiators</li>
            <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Messaging framework — homepage copy direction, pitch angles, and content hooks</li>
            <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Review, refinement, and a written implementation roadmap</li>
            <li>A final deliverable document with all outputs consolidated</li>

        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>Expected outcome</h4>
          <p>By the end of 4 weeks, you have a messaging foundation you can use across your site, investor materials, sales conversations, and content — built collaboratively, not handed down.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>Who it's for</h4>
          <p>Post-launch founders who need a strategic partner as their brand and market evolve. You've done the foundational work, but you need someone in your corner as you scale messaging across channels, enter new segments, or prepare for fundraising.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>What problem it solves</h4>
          <p>Branding isn't a one-time project. Markets shift, competitors emerge, and your own product changes. Without ongoing strategic input, messaging drifts and conversion suffers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>What you get</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Two 60-minute strategy sessions per month</li>
            <li>Async support via email for quick-turn questions and reviews (48-hour response time)</li>
            <li>Monthly competitive and market positioning check-in (written memo)</li>
            <li>Priority access for urgent messaging needs (pitch deck due Friday, a launch announcement)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>Expected outcome</h4>
          <p>Your messaging stays sharp as your company grows. You make fewer costly communication mistakes. You have a trusted advisor who understands your brand deeply — not someone re-learning your business every call.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-detail__block">
          <h4>Boundaries</h4>
          <p>Minimum 3-month commitment. This is advisory, not execution — I won't write all your content or manage campaigns, but I'll make sure everything you put out is strategically sound.</p>
