      <p class="section-intro reveal reveal-delay-2">From fintech infrastructure at Amwal Tech to biotech research tools at EG-BIOINFORMATICS — the problem is always the same. The product is real. The story isn't.</p>

      <ul class="why__list">
        <li class="why__item reveal">
          <div class="why__icon">🏗️</div>
          <p>I've worked <strong>inside</strong> early-stage teams across fintech, healthtech, and deep tech — not as an outside observer. I know what it looks like when a strong product can't explain itself.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="why__item reveal reveal-delay-1">
          <div class="why__icon">🎯</div>
          <p>I focus exclusively on technical founders at early-stage companies. Whether you're building financial infrastructure, health tools, or bioinformatics software — I don't need a 3-session onboarding to understand your world.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="why__item reveal reveal-delay-2">
          <div class="why__icon">🚀</div>
          <p>I don't sell ongoing dependency. The goal is messaging strong enough that you can run with it yourself — and know exactly why it works when you do.</p>
